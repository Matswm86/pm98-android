# MAIN MENU (MENUPRINCIPAL) screen — reversed layout from MANAGER.EXE

640×480 px, lifted from `FUN_005469c0` (entry found by the `sub esp,0x230` prologue
at `0x5469c0`, immediately before the first menuprincipal asset xref `0x546a7a`).
Decompile: `docs/re/menu/fn_005469c0_FUN_005469c0.c`. Anchored on the
`recursos\iconos\menuprincipal\*.bmp` asset strings (file off 2474184…2476076 →
`.data` VA 0x65dac8…). Immediates read straight from capstone, not the lossy
decompile (the decompiler hides the `push`-arg order).

The in-game management hub: 12 picture icons in two vertical bands of three rows per
side, around a central club panel + a four-button control bar.

Geometry helpers (same family proven on finance/squad/lineup/transfer):
- `FUN_00436fb0(x,y)` → a point. **thiscall**: `push y; push x; lea ecx,out; call`;
  the LAST push is `x`. Verified against every icon (pt#1 `x`/`y` == the extracted
  BMP's w/h, e.g. MARCAOFF is 86×60 and pt#1 = (86,60)).
- Each icon emits TWO `FUN_00436fb0`: pt#1 = **size** (w,h), pt#2 = **pos** (x,y);
  `FUN_00436fd0(pos,size)` → `Rect(x,y,x+w,y+h)`.
- `FUN_00436240` = `CRect::CRect(l,t,r,b)` → the caption (label) rect, `l` = last push.
- `FUN_00437020(r,g,b)` set caption colour (`r` = last push; stores bytes [r,g,b,0]).
- `FUN_005c06d0(this,"...bmp",…)` blits an icon bitmap state.

## Assets (all in RECURSOS.PKF, OS/2-core 8-bpp BMP, NO embedded palette)
Render with the **shared VGA palette** (`DAT.PKF+0x5ca`, R,G,B order), index 0
transparent — NOT MANAGER.PAL/MENU.PAL (those scramble these icons). Each menu item
has `*off` (active), `*on` (hover) and/or `*gris` (disabled) states; we bundle the
`off` (active) state.

| icon  | RECURSOS entry | size  | action  | caption        |

`✓` = caption is the EXE's own inline `.data` string sitting right after that icon's
`off.bmp` path (FIXTURES/OPPONENT/STAFF/FINANCE/BOARD ROOM). The other six carry no
inline string (their widget text is resource-ID driven, ID table not reversed); they
use the game's own English vocabulary present elsewhere in MANAGER.EXE (LEAGUE TABLES,
LINE-UP, TACTICS, SIGN PLAYER, STADIUM) + RESULTS for the marcador/scoreboard icon.

## Reversed coordinates (pos = top-left, size = w×h)
- Picture rects (the hit areas, all non-overlapping):
  MARCA(7,71) CLASI(206,93) CALEN(10,147) ALINE(535,70) TACTI(345,101) RIVAL(536,151)
  FICHA(7,327) VENDE(184,353) EMPLE(6,403) CAJA(559,328) DECIS(361,370) ESTAD(543,415).
  (FICHA's pos.x is a register; its left-column siblings are x=6/7/10 → 7.)
- Caption rects sit beside each icon (left column: label right of icon; right column:
  label left of icon) and line up with the grey label slots of `trozo_fondo`.
- Caption colours by group: top-left RESULTS/LEAGUE/FIXTURES = (200,230,60) lime;
  top-right LINE-UP/TACTICS/OPPONENT = (127,191,255) cornflower; bottom-left
  SIGN/SELL/STAFF = (255,191,170) peach; bottom-right FINANCE/BOARD/STADIUM =
  (255,223,85) gold.
- Control bar (y=255): EXIT(6,255,79×27) SAVE GAME(92,255,114×27) NEWS(437,255,95×27)
  CONTINUE(540,255,95×27). Strings confirmed inline ("EXIT" 0x65ccb0, "SAVE GAME"
  0x65dc08, "NEWS" 0x65dba8, "CONTINUE" 0x652f54). The centre gap (x214-426) holds
  the live club panel.
- Background: `trozo_fondo.bmp` (640×158) blitted per band at y=63 and y=321; the menu
  is left-right symmetric, so a horizontally-mirrored copy supplies the right-column
  grey slots (trozo's left slot at x63-207 mirrors to x433-577 = the reversed right
  caption x-range). Friendly-match mode swaps in `fondo_amistoso.bmp` (not used here).

## Build mapping (→ `app/scenes/MenuScreen.gd`)
- The whole static chrome (trozo bands + mirror + 12 icons + captions + control bar +
  the four FUN_004b7f40 side panels) is **baked** to `app/art/screens/menu_bg.png`
  by `tools/re/preview_menu.py --bake`, the same one-PNG pattern as fondo_marble.png.
- `MenuScreen.gd` blits menu_bg, overlays the live club panel (name / league / season
  / cash / position) in the centre gap, and is INTERACTIVE: `_hit()` maps a tap (after
  the inverse scale/offset) to an action via the reversed picture rects + control rects
  and emits `action_selected`. Native 640×480, scales to fit (NEAREST).
- `Main.gd` mounts it as a full-screen overlay from the career hub ("MAIN MENU (the
  screen)") and routes actions: table→league screen, lineup→line-up screen,
  finance→finances, buy→transfer market, tactics/sell/results→text views,
  continue→advance week, save/news/staff/stadium/board/opponent→toast, exit→dismiss.
