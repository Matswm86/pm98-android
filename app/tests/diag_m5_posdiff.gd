## M5 s30: port-vs-reference full-roster position diff at the observable ticks (clk 10/11/12).
## Byte-loads frame0 (seed 0xea0d2a8d), ticks to clk 12, dumps all 22 player positions +
## Bolton/Villa ctx 0x200/0x204 designations per tick 8..11 (JSON to stdout, PY compares).
## Run: ~/godot462 --headless --path app --script res://tests/diag_m5_posdiff.gd
