## EXACT port of MANAGER.EXE's per-tick movement layer (docs/re/EXACT_PORT_PLAN.md,
## Stage 3 task 2 -- the driver-called movement primitives). FIRST slice:
##   * select_nearest = FUN_005b8ce0 (__thiscall, this=sim-context) -- pick the
##     eligible player nearest to the ball (3D Euclidean) and make it the active
##     player, with an optional "in front of the ball's facing" cone gate. The
##     driver (FUN_00598740) calls it 2x/tick in the default open-play path, and
##     it is the else-branch fallback of the phase selector FUN_005b8f20.
##
## NAMING CORRECTION (vs the 2026-06-18 handoff): FUN_005b8f20 is the *phase-based
## active-player selector*, NOT "ball physics". The actual physics is spread across
## FUN_005b8690 (pairwise player/ball relationship matrix), FUN_005b94f0 (marker
## assignment) and this FUN_005b8ce0 (nearest-to-ball). Those remain to be ported.
##
## FUN_005b8ce0 decoded (disasm 0x5b8ce0..0x5b8f11, no RNG):
##   1. Entry ownership guard. ctrl=match+0x1650 (controlling player ptr), with
##      match+0x1664 the controlling team index; other=match+0x165c (a 2nd control
##      ptr) with other+0x2b8 its team. If our movement-context's team (ctx+0x8)
##      already controls via ctrl -> active := ctrl (no search). Else if it controls
##      via other -> active := other. Else run the nearest-player search.
##   2. Search: min-dist accumulator = 0x12c0000 (300.0 units in 16.16). For each
##      player with the on-pitch flag player+0x2bc != 0, dist = ftol(sqrt(dx^2 +
##      dy^2 + dz^2)) where d = player.xyz(+4/+8/+0xc) - ball.xyz(match+0x1614/
##      +0x1618/+0x161c). When find_in_front, gate first: skip unless
##      abs(s16(atan_angle(dx,dy) - ball.facing(match+0x1644))) < 0x3555 (a ~+/-75
##      deg cone). Nearest within 300u wins; below that, the prior active stays.
##      Special: if find_in_front==0 and the current active has the lock byte
##      player+0x5d != 0, keep it (skip the search).
##   3. Commit: clear old active's player+0x5c flag, set new active ptr (ctx+0x168),
##      set its +0x5c. If the active CHANGED and the new player's team-info flag
##      teaminfo(+0x184)+0x2ee is set AND the match phase (FUN_005943b0: new+0x18c ->
##      +0x468 -> +0xfa0 == 0) holds, zero the new active's velocity (+0x54/+0x58).
##   ftol is the binary's unbound msvcrt _ftol = truncate-toward-zero; GDScript
##   int(sqrt(.)) reproduces it (the oracle injects a faithful truncating _ftol --
##   the binary's `jmp [0x6233a4]` thunk is unmapped in the static image).
##
## STRUCT MODEL (matches Pm98Events/Pm98Predicates' offset->Variant Dictionaries,
## with one deliberate difference): player *pointers* are modelled as INDICES into
## ctx["players"] (an Array of player Dicts), because this function compares and
## stores player identities and iterates the array. A null pointer == index -1.
##   ctx["players"]  Array[Dictionary]  the 22-player array (base = *param_1)
##   ctx[0x8]        int                this movement-context's team index (param_1[2])
##   ctx[0x138]      Dictionary         the match (param_1[0x4e])
##   ctx[0x168]      int                active-player index, -1 = null (param_1[0x5a])
## match fields: 0x1614/0x1618/0x161c ball xyz, 0x1644 ball facing (s16),
##   0x1650 controlling-player INDEX (-1 none), 0x1664 controlling team index,
##   0x165c other-control-player INDEX (-1 none), 0x468 -> {0xfa0: phase}.
## player fields: 0x4/0x8/0xc xyz, 0x2bc on-pitch flag, 0x5c active flag, 0x5d lock,
##   0x54/0x58 velocity, 0x2b8 team, 0x184 -> {0x2ee: team flag}, 0x18c -> match.
